Nmap Post Port Scans

Activity description: This activity focused on the final stages of a network scan to extract detailed intelligence from discovered open ports. I used Nmap to perform service version detection, operating system fingerprinting, and traceroute analysis. Additionally, I explored the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to automate security checks and learned how to save scan results in various formats for professional reporting.

Tools used: Nmap (Network Mapper); Linux Terminal (Attack box), Target VM (TryHackMe Lab Environment)

Methodology:
1.	Service Detection - Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service. Adding “-sV” to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. Performed an -sV scan controlling the intensity with “—version-light” and analysed the results.
2.	OS Detection and Traceroute – Learned that Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using “-O”. OS detection might not be accurate, and one of the factors is that Nmap might not find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies.
“Traceroute” is used to find the routers between the user and the target. As opposed to the Linux “traceroute” command that starts with a low TTL and keeps increasing it until it reaches the target, Nmap’s command starts with a high TTL and keeps decreasing it. 
3.	Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) - A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. Nmap provides support for scripts using the Lua language. You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. By using “-sC” you will ensure that Nmap will execute the default scripts. Performed a default script scan and a specific scrip scan on a provided IP.
4.	Saving the output - Whenever you run a Nmap scan, it is only reasonable to save the results in a file. Selecting and adopting a good naming convention for your filenames is also crucial. Learned the 3 most common naming formats: normal, Grepable, XML.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to identify specific service versions and operating systems to find potential vulnerabilities. I understood that while automated detection is powerful, virtualization can sometimes distort these results. Finally, I mastered the use of NSE scripts for advanced discovery and learned the importance of saving scan outputs in different formats to keep a documented record of network findings.
