Network Anlysis and Security Labs

Hi, my name is Federico.
In this repository you will find all the reports of practical excersices that I did to gain hands-on experience with the most common tools used in network administration and security.

The other branch, GymLog, is a website that I designed as the final project for CS50x Intoduction to Computer Science Harvard's course.
